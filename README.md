"This is basic code of python to pratice."

"This shows how to build basic calculator using conditional statements."

The program starts by printing out the available operations for the user to choose from: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.

The program prompts the user to enter their choice of operation. The user's input is stored in the choice variable as a string.

The program asks the user to input two numbers. These inputs are converted from strings to integers and stored in the variables num1 and num2.

The program uses a series of if, elif, and else statements to check which operation the user selected and perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.

# Condition to apply
(i) If the user chose '1', the program adds the two numbers and prints the result.

(ii) If the user chose '2', the program subtracts the second number from the first and prints the result. 

(iii) If the user chose '3', the program multiplies the two numbers and prints the result. 

(iv) If the user chose '4', the program divides the first number by the second, but only if the second number is not zero. If the second number is zero, it prints an error message. 

(v)If the user enters any choice other than '1', '2', '3', or '4', the program prints an error message indicating an invalid input.
